# Tic-tac-toe

A small project using the [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) and [alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) algorithms to play tic-tac-toe.

My main aim with this project is to write a reference repository for tree search algorithms that can then be applied to other games.
